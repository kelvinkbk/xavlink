# Real-time Chat and Notification Fixes for Mobile App

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Chat Real-time Updates**

- ✅ Added socket listeners for `receive_message` in ChatListScreen
- ✅ Added socket listeners for `unread_count_update` to update unread counts
- ✅ Added socket listeners for `chat_read` to mark chats as read
- ✅ Implemented `markChatAsRead()` API call when entering a chat
- ✅ Fixed HTTP method: Changed from PUT to POST to match backend route

### 2. **Typing Indicators**

- ✅ Added typing indicator display in ChatScreen
- ✅ Implemented `sendTyping()` and `sendStopTyping()` socket events

### 3. **Notification Real-time**

- ✅ Enhanced notification logging in NotificationsScreen
- ✅ Prevents duplicate notifications from being added
- ✅ Properly handles `newNotification` from SyncContext
- ✅ Added unread count tracking

### 4. **Socket Connection Improvements**

- ✅ Upgraded socket transport from `polling-only` to `websocket + polling`
- ✅ Smart transport selection: polling for HTTPS/production, websocket for local dev
- ✅ Fixed websocket errors on Render.com by using polling for HTTPS
- ✅ Added reconnection event logging
- ✅ Added transport type logging (shows if using websocket or polling)
- ✅ Increased timeout to 10 seconds for better reliability
- ✅ Enhanced user online status tracking in AuthContext

### 5. **Chat Service API**

- ✅ Added `markChatAsRead()` method to API service
- ✅ Fixed HTTP method from PUT to POST to match backend route
- ✅ Integrated with backend `/chats/:chatId/read` endpoint

### 6. **UI Fixes**

- ✅ Fixed incorrect text rendering in DiscoverScreen
- ✅ Replaced Fragment (`<>`) with View wrapper for message button layout

   - Added `handleTextChange()` for typing events
   - Added `typingUsers` state and display
   - Calls `markChatAsRead()` when entering chat
   - Listens for: `user_typing`, `user_stopped_typing`

3. **mobile/src/screens/NotificationsScreen.jsx**

5. **mobile/src/services/api.js**
   - Added `markChatAsRead()` method to chatService
   - Fixed HTTP method from PUT to POST

6. **mobile/src/services/socket.js**
   - Added `markChatAsRead()` method to chatService
   - Fixed HTTP method from PUT to POST

7. **mobile/src/services/socket.js**
   - Smart transport selection based on protocol (HTTPS vs HTTP)
   - Uses polling for HTTPS to avoid websocket errors on Render
   - Uses websocket for local development
   - Added reconnection event handlers
   - Added transport type logging

8. **mobile/src/screens/DiscoverScreen.jsx**
   - Fixed React Native text rendering error
   - Wrapped message button Text components in View instead of Fragment

## How It Works

### Real-time Chat Flow

1. User opens ChatScreen → joins chat room via `joinRoom(chatId)`
2. User sends message → `sendMessage()` emits to backend
3. Backend broadcasts to room → all users receive via `receive_message`
4. Message appears instantly in chat for all participants
5. Unread counts update via `unread_count_update` event
6. When user opens chat → `markChatAsRead()` is called → `chat_read` event emitted

### Typing Indicators

1. User types → `handleTextChange()` triggers → `sendTyping()` emitted
2. Backend broadcasts to other users in chat room
3. Other users see "User is typing..." message
4. After 2 seconds of no typing → `sendStopTyping()` emitted
5. Typing indicator disappears

### Real-time Notifications

1. Backend creates notification → emits `new_notification` to `user:${userId}` room
2. Mobile socket (connected via `markUserOnline()`) receives event
3. SyncContext updates `syncEvents.newNotification`
4. NotificationsScreen listens to SyncContext and adds to list
5. Duplicate check prevents multiple additions

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open two devices with different users
- [ ] Send message from device 1 → appears on device 2 immediately
- [ ] Type on device 1 → device 2 shows typing indicator
- [ ] Stop typing → typing indicator disappears after 2 seconds
- [ ] Send notification → appears in real-time on recipient device
- [ ] Unread count updates when new message arrives
- [ ] Unread count resets when opening chat
- [ ] Socket reconnects automatically after network loss
- [ ] Works on both WiFi and mobile data

## Backend Events Reference

### Chat Events (Server → Client)

- `receive_message` - New message in chat
- `unread_count_update` - Unread count changed
- `chat_read` - Chat marked as read
- `user_typing` - User is typing
- `user_stopped_typing` - User stopped typing

### Notification Events (Server → Client)

- `new_notification` - New notification received
- `notification:unread-count` - Unread notification count update

### Client → Server Events

- `join_room` - Join a chat room
- `send_message` - Send a message
- `typing` - User started typing
- `stop_typing` - User stopped typing
- `user_online` - Mark user as online (joins user room)

## Performance Improvements

1. **WebSocket First**: Reduced latency by using websocket instead of long polling
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Messages appear instantly before server confirmation
3. **Throttled Typing**: Only sends typing events when actually typing
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Avoids re-rendering duplicate notifications
5. **Auto-cleanup**: Removes socket listeners when components unmount

## Troubleshooting

### If messages don't appear in real-time

1. Check socket connection in console (look for "✅ Socket connected")
2. Verify transport type (should be "websocket" or fallback to "polling")
3. Check if user joined room (look for "🟢 Joined chat room")
4. Verify backend is running and accessible

### If typing indicator doesn't work

1. Ensure both users are in the same chat room
2. Check socket events in console
3. Verify `handleTextChange` is being called

### If notifications don't appear

1. Check if `markUserOnline()` was called successfully
2. Verify backend emits to correct room: `user:${userId}`
3. Check SyncContext is wrapping the app in App.js
